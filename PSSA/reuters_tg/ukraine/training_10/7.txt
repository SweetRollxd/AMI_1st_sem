Ukraine's Zelenskiy tells U.S. Congress aid is 'not charity', urges more support

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the U.S. Congress that aid to Ukraine was an investment in democracy and "not charity" as he invoked American battles against the Nazis in World War Two to press for more assistance for his country's war effort.

Zelenskiy's comments on Wednesday come as Republicans - some of whom have voiced increasing scepticism about sending so much aid to Ukraine - are set to take control of the U.S. House of Representatives from Democrats on Jan. 3.

Some hardline Republicans have even urged an end to aid and an audit to trace how allocated money has been spent.

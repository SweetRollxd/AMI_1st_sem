Ukraine's Zelenskiy goes to Washington seeking 'weapons, weapons and more weapons'

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was en route to the United States on Wednesday to meet President Joe Biden, address Congress and seek "weapons, weapons and more weapons" in his first overseas trip 300 days since Russia invaded his country.

Zelenskiy said the visit was aimed at strengthening Ukraine's "resilience and defence capabilities" amid repeated Russian attacks on energy and water supplies in the dead of winter.

Presidential political adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said Zelenskiy's U.S. visit showed the high degree of trust between the two countries and offered him the opportunity to explain what weapons Kyiv needs.

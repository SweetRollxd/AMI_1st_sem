Division at G20 over bid to condemn Russia's Ukraine invasion


NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Disagreement emerged at a Group of 20 (G20) summit on Tuesday as the United States and its allies backed a resolution condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Russia's foreign minister dismissed as unwarranted politicisation.

"Most members strongly condemned the war in Ukraine and stressed it is causing immense human suffering and exacerbating existing fragilities in the global economy," a 16-page draft declaration said, according to a copy seen by Reuters.

"There were other views and different assessments of the situation and sanctions," said the draft, which diplomats said had yet to be adopted by the leaders.

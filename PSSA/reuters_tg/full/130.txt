Putin says Xi has concern over Ukraine, praises China's position


Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday said he understood that Xi Jinping had questions and concern about the situation in Ukraine but praised China's leader for what he said was a "balanced" position on the conflict.

Russia's war in Ukraine has killed tens of thousands of people and pushed the global economy into uncharted waters with soaring prices for food and energy amid the biggest confrontation between Moscow with the West since the Cold War.

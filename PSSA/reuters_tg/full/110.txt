Myanmar's Suu Kyi gets jail with hard labour for election fraud


Myanmar's deposed former leader Aung San Suu Kyi was found guilty of electoral fraud on Friday and sentenced to three years in jail with hard labour, according to a source familiar with the proceedings.

The Nobel laureate and figurehead of Myanmar's opposition to decades of military rule has been detained since a coup early last year and has already been sentenced to more than 17 years in prison. She denies all the allegations against her.

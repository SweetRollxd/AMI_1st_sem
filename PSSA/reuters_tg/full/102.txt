Indonesia to investigate military officers for alleged murders in Papua


Authorities in Indonesia's Papua region have detained six army officers and launched an investigation into their alleged involvement in the brutal murder of four civilians last week, military officials said on Monday.

Teguh Muji Angkasa, a senior military officer in Papua, told a televised news briefing the military and police would conduct a joint investigation.

"We have been given the order to investigate the incident," said Teguh, "and if from the results of the investigation, soldiers were involved, they will be sternly sanctioned."

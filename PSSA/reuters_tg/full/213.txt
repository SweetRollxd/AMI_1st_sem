Exclusive: Nvidia offers new advanced chip for China that meets U.S. export controls


U.S. chip maker Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) is offering a new advanced chip in China that meets recent export control rules aimed at keeping cutting-edge technology out of China's hands, the company confirmed on Monday.

Nvidia responded to Reuters' reporting that Chinese computer sellers are advertising products with the new chip.

The chip, called the A800, represents the first reported effort by a U.S. semiconductor company to create advanced processors for China that follow new U.S. trade rules. Nvidia has said the export limitations could cost it hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.

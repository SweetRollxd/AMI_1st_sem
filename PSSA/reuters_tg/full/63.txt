Indonesia opens temporary access to PayPal after blocking sparks backlash


Indonesia temporarily opened access to online payment firm PayPal (PYPL.O) to allow users to access their money, a senior official said on Sunday, after the country's blocking of some online services and games sparked an outcry.

The Indonesian communication ministry on Saturday blocked PayPal, search engine website Yahoo, and several gaming services due to failures to meet a deadline under licensing rules.

Shares slip, euro hits 20-year low on energy ills


European stock futures slid on Monday while the euro took a fresh spill after Russia shut a major gas pipeline to Europe, leading some governments there to announce emergency measures to ease the pain of soaring energy prices.

The euro lost 0.5% to a two-decade low of $0.9900 as markets priced in more risk of a European recession, while

EUROSTOXX 50 futures shed 3.0% and FTSE futures 1.0%.

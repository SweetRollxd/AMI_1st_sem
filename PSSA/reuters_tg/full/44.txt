SEC Calls 9 Cryptos 'Securities' in Insider Trading Case


The federal securities regulator filed a complaint Thursday alleging a former Coinbase (COIN) product manager engaged in insider trading by giving his brother and a friend tips on which assets the exchange planned to list in the near future. In an unusual move, the SEC also explicitly said nine of the crypto assets listed were securities.

While the SEC has identified cryptocurrencies as securities in the past, typically it did so in enforcement actions or settlements with the issuer. But Thursday’s complaint is the first time the SEC identified several cryptocurrencies as securities without charging the issuers – or, for that matter, the exchange listing the so-called securities. The tokens listed were Flexa’s AMP, RLY, DDX, XYO, RGT, LCX, POWR, DFX and KROM.

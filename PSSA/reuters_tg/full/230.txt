China's Xi confronts Canada's Trudeau at G20 over media leaks


In video footage published by Canadian broadcasters, Xi and Trudeau can be seen standing close to each other and conversing via a translator at the summit on the Indonesian island of Bali.

"That is not appropriate, and we didn't do it that way," Xi said in Mandarin, smiling.

"If there is sincerity, we can communicate well with mutual respect, otherwise the outcome will not be easy to tell."

His displeasure was likely a reference to media reports that Trudeau brought up "serious concerns" about alleged espionage and Chinese "interference" in Canadian elections when meeting with Xi on Tuesday, his first talks with the Chinese leader in more than three years.

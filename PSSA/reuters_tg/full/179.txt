Tesla investors to focus on demand issues in earnings report


Tesla Inc's (<TSLA.O>) quarterly report on Wednesday will likely show whether the Elon Musk-led electric-vehicle maker is facing any weakness in demand that is starting to weigh on the wider auto industry.

Decades-high inflation, rising energy bills in Europe and signs of a weakening China market have raised doubts among some analysts about whether Tesla can buck an economic slowdown and continue to raise prices without hurting its sales.

Exclusive: Senior Indonesian officials targeted by spyware last year â€“ sources


More than a dozen senior Indonesian government and military officials were targeted last year with spy software designed by an Israeli surveillance firm, according to nine people with knowledge of the matter.

Six of the individuals told Reuters they were targeted themselves.

The targets included Chief Economic Minister Airlangga Hartarto, senior military personnel, two regional diplomats, and advisers in Indonesia's defence and foreign affairs ministries, according to the people. 

Six of the Indonesian officials and advisers targeted told Reuters they received an email message from Apple Inc (AAPL.O) in November 2021 telling them that Apple believed officials were being "targeted by state-sponsored attackers."

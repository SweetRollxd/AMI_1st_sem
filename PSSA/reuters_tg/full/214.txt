Exclusive: China cancelled EU leader's video address at opening of major trade expo


Chinese authorities behind a major trade expo in Shanghai pulled an opening ceremony address by the European Council president that was set to criticise Russia's "illegal war" in Ukraine and call for reduced EU trade dependency on China, diplomats said.

The pre-recorded video by Charles Michel was meant to be one of several from world leaders and heads of international organisations, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, at the opening of the China International Import Expo (CIIE) on Friday, three European diplomats told Reuters. 

The diplomats, who cannot be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, told Reuters they were surprised that the speech had been removed.

Ex-cop kills 22 children, 12 others in Thai mass shooting


A former policeman killed 34 people including 22 children in a gun rampage at a daycare centre in Thailand on Thursday, later shooting dead his wife and child at their home before turning his weapon on himself, police officials said.

Police identified the attacker as a former member of the force who was dismissed from his post last year over drug allegations.

The man had been facing trial on a drugs charge and had been in court in the hours before the shooting, a police spokesperson told broadcaster ThaiPBS.

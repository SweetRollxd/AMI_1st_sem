Prescient or traitor? Rishi Sunak is the favourite to be next UK PM


To some Conservatives, Rishi Sunak is the minister who got Britain through the COVID pandemic, to others the traitor who knifed Boris Johnson or the rival to Liz Truss who presciently warned her tax plans would bring chaos.

Now he has to weigh up whether he can convince Britain's governing party he is the man to save it from chaos.

The former finance minister was runner-up in the last contest to become Britain's prime minister which only concluded six weeks ago, despite being the most popular candidate amongst Conservative lawmakers in parliament.

It was Sunak's dramatic decision to quit in July which set off a wave of resignations by ministers, ultimately forcing Johnson to reluctantly give up the top job in Downing Street.

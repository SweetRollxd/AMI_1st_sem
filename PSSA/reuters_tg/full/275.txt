Biden signs marriage equality act to tune of Cyndi Lauper's 'True Colors'


U.S. President Joe Biden signed the Respect for Marriage Act into law on Tuesday at a jubilant celebration that featured U.S. singer Cyndi Lauper performing "True Colors" in front of thousands of supporters on the White House lawn.

The new law provides federal recognition to same-sex marriages, a measure born out of concern that the Supreme Court could reverse its legal support of such relationships.

Cheers erupted from the crowd as Biden signed the bill.

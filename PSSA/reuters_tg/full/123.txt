King Charles vows to follow queen's example as he is proclaimed monarch


King Charles pledged on Saturday to follow the example of his late mother as he was officially proclaimed as Britain's new monarch on Saturday at a historic ceremony in St James's Palace.

The death of 96-year-old Queen Elizabeth on Thursday after 70 years on the throne set in train long-established and highly choreographed plans for days of national mourning and a state funeral that will be held in just over a week.

"In taking up these responsibilities, I shall strive to follow the inspiring example I have been set in upholding constitutional government and to seek the peace, harmony and prosperity of the peoples of these islands and of the Commonwealth realms and territories throughout the world."

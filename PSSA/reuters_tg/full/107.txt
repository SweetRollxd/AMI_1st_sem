Germany says it will expand military presence in Indo-Pacific


Germany will expand its military presence in the Indo-Pacific by sending more warships and joining drills with allies as it keeps an eye on the "enormous" build-up of China's armed forces, the German defence chief told Reuters.

Germany is joining other Western nations in showing more muscle in the region amid growing alarm over Beijing's territorial ambitions.

Last year, Berlin sent its first warship in almost 20 years to the disputed waters of the South China Sea - at the risk of irking its top trade partner - and this month it sent 13 military aircraft to joint exercises in Australia.

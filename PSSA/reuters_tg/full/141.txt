Queen's final resting place is a small chapel in historic Windsor Castle


At the end of a state funeral watched by millions of people the world over, Queen Elizabeth was being brought home to her beloved Windsor Castle to be buried in a small chapel in a private ceremony.

Originally built by William the Conqueror after the Norman conquest in 1066, Windsor Castle has been rebuilt and remodelled over the centuries but is the oldest and largest occupied castle in the world. 

Just outside London, it was the queen's main weekend retreat and in the later years of her reign her preferred home.

Elon Musk restores Twitter accounts of journalists after suspensions draw backlash


Elon Musk reinstated the Twitter accounts of several journalists that were suspended for a day over a controversy on publishing public data about the billionaire's plane.

The reinstatements came after the unprecedented suspensions evoked stinging criticism from government officials, advocacy groups and journalism organizations from several parts of the globe on Friday, with some saying the microblogging platform was jeopardizing press freedom.

A Twitter pollthat Musk conducted later also showed that a majority of the respondents wanted the accounts restored immediately.

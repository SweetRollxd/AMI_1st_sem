Trump 'unlikely' to be president after hosting Fuentes, top Republican McConnell suggests


The top two Republicans in the U.S. Congress broke their silence on Tuesday about former President Donald Trump's dinner last week with white supremacist Nick Fuentes, saying the Republican Party has no place for antisemitism or white supremacy.

Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and Representative Kevin McCarthy, who may become speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives when Republicans take control in January, had not commented previously on the Nov. 22 meeting.

Trump began his 2024 bid for the White House on Nov. 15, and is Republican voters' top choice, according to opinion polls.

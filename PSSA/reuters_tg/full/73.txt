Taiwan says Chinese planes, ships carry out attack simulation exercise


Taiwan officials said Chinese aircraft and warships rehearsed an attack on the island on Saturday, part of Beijing's retaliation for a visit there by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that has also seen it halt talks with the United States on issues including defence and climate change.

Pelosi's brief visit this week to the self-ruled island that China regards as its territory infuriated Beijing and prompted unprecedented military drills that have included ballistic missiles fired over the capital, Taipei.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused China of taking "irresponsible steps" by halting key communication channels with Washington, and said its actions over Taiwan showed a move from prioritising peaceful resolution towards use of force.

Germany to legalize cannabis use for recreational purposes


Germany set out plans on Wednesday to legalise cannabis, a move Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government said would make Germany one of the first countries in Europe to do so.

Health Minister Karl Lauterbach presented a cornerstone paper on planned legislation to regulate the controlled distribution and consumption of cannabis for recreational purposes among adults.

Acquiring and possessing 20 to 30 grams of recreational cannabis for personal consumption would also be made legal.

Markets buoyed by reports of U-turn by UK PM Truss on tax plans


Prime Minister Liz Truss is rethinking tax-cut plans that sent markets into turmoil with a possible U-turn on business levies, British media reported on Thursday, although her office said there would be no change of course.

Truss's economic package, announced last month, has caused a rout in the government bond market, with some investors and Conservative Party lawmakers calling on her to reverse a plan for 43 billion pounds ($48 billion) of unfunded tax cuts, including a move to hold corporation tax at just 19%.

Iranian state-sponsored marchers call for execution of rioters


State-organised demonstrations to counter nationwide anti-government protests triggered by the death of a woman in police custody kicked off in several Iranian cities on Friday, with marchers calling for the execution of rioters.

Demonstrators condemned the anti-government protesters as "Israel's soldiers", live state television coverage showed. They also shouted “Death to America” and “Death to Israel", common slogans the country's clerical rulers use to try and stir up support for authorities.

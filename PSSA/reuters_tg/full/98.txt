Last reactors at occupied Ukrainian nuclear plant shut down after power lines damaged- Energoatom


The last two working reactors at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine shut down on Thursday after nearby fires damaged overhead power lines, Ukraine's state nuclear company Energoatom said.

Fires broke out in the ash pits of a coal plant located near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant - Europe's largest - and damaged the power lines connecting the nuclear plant to Ukraine's grid, the company said.

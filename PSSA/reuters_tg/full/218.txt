Crypto markets slump as FTX seeks to raise new funds


Cryptocurrency markets nursed heavy losses on Thursday, with bitcoin hovering near a two-year low as investors fretted about the fallout from the implosion of crypto exchange FTX, which was seeking new funds to plug a gaping hole in its finances.

Larger rival Binance walked away from a bailout of FTX on Wednesday, sending cryptocurrency prices plunging as hopes for a rescue diminished.

On Thursday, FTX head Sam Bankman-Fried told staff in a Slack message seen by Reuters that "for the next week, we will be conducting a raise".
